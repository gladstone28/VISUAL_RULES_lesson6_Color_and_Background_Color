VISUAL RULES
Color and Background Color
Before discussing the specifics of color, it’s important to make two distinctions about color. Color can affect the following design aspects:

Foreground color
Background color
Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground color of the heading has been styled. Conversely, when a heading is styled so that its background appears yellow, the background color of the heading has been styled.

In CSS, these two design aspects can be styled with the following two properties:

color: this property styles an element’s foreground color
background-color: this property styles an element’s background color
